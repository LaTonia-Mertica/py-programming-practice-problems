print('Hello Python Code World!')
# python prefers single quotes over doubles
print(input('How are you today? '))
# input is written input() with what will prompt user input/entry inside the parentheses inside quotation marks
print('Please look for me, because I\'m coming.')
# to escape the single quote symbol means to tell the python program you are writing to allow it to present as a basic symbol ... you escape by adding the backslash (\) symbol in front of the single quote like as seen above
